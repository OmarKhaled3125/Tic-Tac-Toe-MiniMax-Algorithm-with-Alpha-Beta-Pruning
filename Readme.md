# Tic Tac Toe - Artificial Intelligence Project

This project is a command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python, featuring an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Requirements

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
